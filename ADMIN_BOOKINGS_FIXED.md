# 🔧 Admin Bookings Panel - Fixed! ✅

## 🎉 **All PHP Deprecation Warnings Resolved**

I've successfully fixed all the `number_format()` deprecation warnings in the admin bookings panel and enhanced it with professional navigation!

---

## ❌ **Issues That Were Fixed**

### **🚨 PHP Deprecation Warnings:**
1. **number_format() null parameter** - Lines 168, 174, and admin-functions.php line 222
2. **Missing sidebar navigation** - Page lacked consistent admin interface
3. **Inconsistent styling** - Didn't match other admin pages

### **⚠️ Specific Errors Resolved:**
- `Deprecated: number_format(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($num) of type float is deprecated`
- Missing professional admin navigation
- Inconsistent layout structure

---

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **🔧 1. Fixed Number Format Issues:**

**Root Cause:** Database queries returning `null` values when no bookings exist, and PHP 8+ doesn't allow `null` in `number_format()`.

**Before (Broken):**
```php
// These caused deprecation warnings when values were null
echo number_format($stats['total_bookings']);
echo number_format($stats['confirmed_bookings']);
echo number_format($stats['cancelled_bookings']);
return number_format($price, 0) . ' CFA';
```

**After (Fixed):**
```php
// Enhanced query with COALESCE to prevent null values
$stats_sql = "
    SELECT 
        COALESCE(COUNT(*), 0) as total_bookings,
        COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) as confirmed_bookings,
        COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) as cancelled_bookings,
        COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'confirmed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END), 0) as total_revenue
    FROM bookings
";

// Ensure all stats are proper types, not null
$stats = [
    'total_bookings' => (int)($stats['total_bookings'] ?? 0),
    'confirmed_bookings' => (int)($stats['confirmed_bookings'] ?? 0),
    'cancelled_bookings' => (int)($stats['cancelled_bookings'] ?? 0),
    'total_revenue' => (float)($stats['total_revenue'] ?? 0)
];

// Fixed formatPrice function
function formatPrice($price) {
    return number_format($price ?? 0, 0) . ' CFA';
}
```
